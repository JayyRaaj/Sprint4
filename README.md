# Unity Robot Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a simple robot with an articulation body in Unity. The robot is designed to stand on a plane and interact with its environment while utilizing inverse kinematics to reach a target.

## Features
- **Articulation Body**: The robot uses Unity's Articulation Body component to simulate realistic joint movements.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: The robot can reach for targets while maintaining its balance on a flat surface.
- **Physics Simulation**: Utilizes Unity's physics engine to ensure accurate interactions with the environment.

## Implementation
- Implemented Forward and Inverse Kinematics for the robotic arm
- Implemented the Robot Arm from Scratch
